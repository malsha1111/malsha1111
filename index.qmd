I am a final-year **B.Sc. (Hons) Statistics undergraduate** at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura with a strong interest in **data science and analytics**. My academic and project experience has equipped me with skills in **statistical modeling, data visualization, analytical problem-solving, and programming** using **R and Python**.

I am passionate about applying data-driven approaches to uncover insights and solve real-world problems. Currently, I am seeking opportunities in **data analysis, business analytics, and data science** where I can contribute my expertise while continuing to grow as a professional in the field.
